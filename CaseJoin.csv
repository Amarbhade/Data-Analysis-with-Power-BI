      &quot;I am programming a PCG controller with PCT 10.1. 
       The issue I am having is that it takes too long to switch from heating and cooling. 
       Because of this delay the unit will not switch to dehumidification until cooling mode. 
       Is there a way to go from heating to cooling faster so the humidity in the space
       will not go so far out of set point.&quot;

It&#39;s not entirely clear to me whether your primary concern is..
   1) a quicker transition to dehumidification operation, or ...
   2) a quicker transition to cooling mode

If the first, please see the attached solution database article 20761 plus sample screen shot &quot;Studio_B_AHU before vs after mod.png&quot; which illustrate modifications to the State Table to allow a transition to dehumidification without first transitioning to cooling mode.

       &quot;2.       Analog Inputs on the NRIOs were bouncing around.  At first, we caught one of the NRIOs was not grounded, but it still exhibited this behavior after the ground was applied.  Chris indicated he did not have this bouncing using the NDIO and the points were still set to slow within the Proxy.&quot;

I logged into this site using the IP information you forwarded, but was not immediately able to observe any &quot;bouncing&quot;; the point histories I looked at didn&#39;t seem to contain any obvious non-linearities, either.   Can you suggest some points to look at which exhibit these symptoms?

In the absence of any other information, my strongest hunch at this point is that this is a noise issue associated either with ...
     * one or more of the UI connections to the NRIO (see attached Niagara Central article 7817), and/or ...
     * the NRIO bus

As Martin has already suggested, it would be good to have a detailed termination diagram to refer to; I would be looking primarily for mis-grounding issues, as well as possible cross-feed of voltages from multiple sources (for example, between the power supply feeding the FX80, the NRIO and any secondary power supplies for active sensors (e.g. 0-10vdc, 4-20mA) connected to the NRIO UIs.

I would also be helpful to have answers to the questions posed in the diagram below;  will stand by for your responses.
    FX80 COM port:  1 or 2?   
    EOL jumper setting:  END?  BIA?  MID?

    RS485 NRIO bus segment:
       * how many devices in all?
       * total length?
       * shielded wire?  shield drain hard grounded in only one location?

    What point types are affected by &quot;bouncing&quot; values...
       *UIs with resistive sensors?
       * UIs with voltage type sensors?
       * UIs with current type sensors?

My first suspicion is that either this station or the Niagara platform has some missing and/or out-of-date and/or corrupted software components that the JciBacnetImportManager is dependent on.  Some things to look for..
       * under Station &gt; Config:
             - is the Facility Explorer node present?
             - is the MyServlet node present?
           (some Niagara programmers sometimes delete things like this to &quot;save space&quot;)

       * in the Software Manager of your Wb PC:
              - is jciCoreParser present and the correct size?
              - is jciBacnetParser present and the correct size?
              - is jciFxDriver present and the correct size?
              - is jciFxDriverAppliance present and the correct size?

If none of the above suggestions yield a solution, here are a couple of alternative ways to proceed:
       - send me a copy of the affected station so I can test it here, or
       - set up Team Viewer 9 so I can see your issue directly

When you start your simulation, do the following:
Set the box to occupied.
Play with the velocity pressure to get the damper to a position other than 0 or 100.
Set your velocity pressure input to .04 (~196CFM)(this should satisfy and stabilize the damper output).
Decrease your zone temperature and see if the heating sequences correctly.

Based on this finding, I took a closer look at the Occupied Zone Sequencing (VAV) HFR finite state machine and identified a condition where the FSM will transition to Box Heating first, even if Supplemental Heating is selected as the primary heating source (see attached &quot;Occupied Zone Sequencing (VAV) HFR marked up.PNG&quot;).

Uninstall and reinstall PCT using these steps: 
1) Move any of your .caf files you may have saved in the CCT including any custom modules, which will be found in 
               C:\Program Files\Johnson Controls\PCT\Custom Control Modules.
2) Use the Add/Remove Programs utility under the Windows Control Panel to uninstall PCT from the computer.
3) Delete the folder C:\Program Files\Johnson Controls\PCT.
4) Delete the folder C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Johnson Controls\MetasysIII\PCT.
5) Delete the folder C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Johnson Controls\MetasysIII\DataAccess.
6) Reboot.
7) Reinstall PCT &quot;

You are concerned that you may have others on your shelf with the same issue; you will undertake to check them (i.e. perform a PCT &gt; Controller Information scan) prior to shipping them to your customers.

Regardless of how many affected devices you ultimately find, I would like to work closely with you to make sure that any returned devices are processed as follows to ensure that the correct QA folks are in the loop in order to conclusively resolve this issue:
          * when you request an RMA number for the return, please specify FAR (i.e Failure Analysis Request)

Reselection of the current device(s) occurs as the load fluctuates, i.e. the expectation is that the current stage will switch off naturally as the load drops and then a new stage (which has either a lower number of starts or lower run hours) will be selected when the load increases again.  One drawback of this approach is that if the load is stable, the current stage will run indefinitely.

If you want to keep the standard PCT control sequence,  you can manually force reselection of the current load *right now* by following this three-step sequence:
    Step 1 .. manually command &quot;Rotate Now&quot; to true
    Step 2 .. artificially drop the load to zero (this could be done by temporarily overriding either the Process Variable value or the Setpoint to make them equal); wait for all stages to drop out
    Step 3 .. release your override to Process Variable or Setpoint; as the MSC stages up, it should select the stages with lower number of starts or lower runtime

In the meantime, here are some known reasons for MSTP communication unreliability:
   
   1) Improper tuning policies assigned to your MSTP points ... for details, please see the attached solution database article 30212 and its collateral documents 
            [BACnet setup for large networks with FX PC controllers.doc and Creating a new tuning policy for specific points.doc]


   2) Bus is excessively busy ... for each affected MSTP network, what is the bus busy time? (from your BACnet property sheet)..


   3) JAR file corruption in the FX Supervisory controller ... in some cases, the JAR files relating to a particular program feature may be missing, corrupted or out-of-date.  Can you advise..
       * what version of Wb/AX (or Wb/N4) is your FX Supervisory controller at? 
       * what patches are loaded?
       * do the JAR file sizes in your FX Supervisory controller  match the corresponding JAR file sizes in your FX Wb of the same version
           when viewed in File Transfer Client?  (if not, recopy the affected JAR files using File Transfer Client)
   

   4) Baud rate is too fast for this installation ... faster baud rates (e.g. 76.8k baud) make a bus more susceptible to noise.  
                Are you seeing &quot;DCMD_MSTP_TX_FRAME&quot; errors in the Application Director?  If so, it may be possible to eliminate some of these by dropping to a slower baud rate.


   5) Mixed baud rates ... please ensure that all of the controllers on the affected bus(ses) are running at the correct baud rate.  If you have any field controllers on this bus that are &quot;auto baud&quot;, it may be necessary to power cycle them so they can re-learn the correct baud rate.


   6) Noise on the MSTP bus ... typically caused by improper configuration or installation issues; 
             for the each affected MSTP network can you advise:
       * how long is the bus run? 
                    (RS485 spec is 4000 feet max) 
                         * is it wired using the recommended 24AWG 3-conductor twisted and shielded cabling?
       * is the shield continuous and grounded only at a single point?
       * how many total devices are on this bus?
               (JCI spec is 64 max)
       * what is the device mix..
             - how many FX-PC (or MS-FEC)?
             - how many Legacy FX?
             - how many TEC2000-series?
             - how many TEC3000-series?
             - how many (and what brand/model) 3rd-party?
       * how many repeaters are on this bus?
       * how many devices are on each bus segment? 
            (RS485 spec is 32 max)

   7) Duplicate BACnet Network IDs and/or duplicate BACnet Device IDs on other segments of the BACnet internetwork that this FX Supervisory controller is connected to;
             to test for this possibility, isolate each affected MSTP bus by either...
             * turning off BACnet routing inside the FX Supervisory controller, or

        confirming that this is actually a hardware problem (Tridium can .. and has .. denied credit
        if they test the returned device and assess that there is &quot;no fault found&quot;)

    b) record the details of the failure so we can more quickly identify failure patterns (and therefore
        provide better and more accurate Help Desk responses for similar calls in the future)

Therefore, can you provide some additional details such as:
    * how long was this device in service?
         Serial number 610006 suggests a date code in the first quarter of 2015, leading me to believe 
          this device may have run reliably for some time prior to the failure. Is this true?

    * did any of the following events occur around the time of the failure..
           software or firmware upgrade?
           changes to the site LAN?
           power outages, lightning storms, etc?

    * which LAN port is affected?
           LAN1?
           LAN2?
           Both?
   
   * which of the following attempted recovery methods were attempted..
           ping the LAN port from a directly-connected PC with same-subnet IP address?

Article ID:9583

Problem:

What are the part numbers for the Facilitator version of the DX9100?
Solution:

As of November, 2005 the FA-DX9100-8454 and the FA-DX9100-7454 (repair) have been discontinued.

Replace the Facilitator panel with a new Supervisory controller and replace the DX components. The N30 controller and NAE controllers will communicate with all versions of N2 controllers, including Facilitator.

FA-DX9100-8454 / FA-DX9100-7454 is the headend electronics. Replace with a DX-9100-8454 or DX-9100-7454 (repair version).
DX-9100-8990 is the wiring termination (still available).
DX-9100-8991 is the cover for the wiring (still available).
FA-DX91-8913 firmware upgrade kit is discontinued. Replace with the DX-9100-8913.&quot;",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,0,9583,FALSE,005G0000007Zl8GIAS,2022-01-25T22:38:44.000Z,0,01tG000000LNu19IAD,aDUG0000000PB9xOAG,0,0,0,a0WG000000JgZYBMA3,0,0,Don Doudna,0,0,0,0,0,Medium,0,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Closed,COMPATABILITY,0,0,0,46638.08205,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE

The &quot;setcmdflags&quot; utility was created by one of our in-house Niagara developers to address requests from multiple customers who wanted to harmonize the menu options available to users throughout an entire station.   Your requirement, the need to specify *different* menu options depending on whether a point resides on the BACnet network or N2 network, therefore represents an enhancement request for this utility.   I will consult with the developer to see whether he might be able to modify this utility to address your requirement (and whether he might be able to do this in a timely fashion).

In the meantime, I will investigate the option of maybe using the Program Editor to selectively change these menu options.

If you are really stuck to get this done, you can hide/unhide command menu options from the slot sheet on a per-point basis.&quot;",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,FALSE,005G0000007Zl8GIAS,2022-01-25T22:39:53.000Z,0,01tG000000LNtyvIAD,aDUG0000000PBC8OAO,0,0,0,0,0,0,Michael McNaught,0,0,0,0,0,Low,0,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Closed,FX70 and operator user priviledges,0,46205.2099,0,23.7954925,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE

There is no field recovery mechanism possible for this condition and the controller will need to be RMA&#39;d. 

That said, I&#39;d like to use your situation as a catalyst to follow up with our factory in conclusively resolving this issue. When you go to RMA the current PCG, could you please: 
* request failure analysis (FAR) 
* have your JCI Product Sales Operations agent include Help Desk case HD 00047124 on the RMA form 
* have your JCI Product Sale Operations agent include Change Request number CR 72184 on the RMA form 

Forward a copy of the completed RMA form to me so I can cross-reference it with this Help Desk case and follow up with the factory.

The download process will prompt you to confirm switching the communication protocol to N2.<br>7) Click OK to accept.<br>8) After the download has completed, disconnect the 24 VAC power supply from the controller.<br>9) Set the 128 DIP switch to ON.<br>10) Reattach the FC Bus (N2) connector to the controller.<br>11) Reconnect the 24 VAC power supply to the controller.Â <br>NOTE: CCT allows addresses &gt;127 to be configured when the N2 Mapping table is populated. If the N2 Mapping table is not populated, the 4-127 address rules are enforced.<br>NOTE: Once a controller is N2 enabled, subsequent downloads may be performed with CCT configured for addresses &gt;127 as the wireless function of the 128 dip switch is disabled in N2 mode.Â <br>Â ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,0,32825,FALSE,005G0000007Zl8wIAC,2017-03-10T18:09:35.000Z,0,01tG000000LNu0tIAD,aDUG0000000PBSMOA4,0,0,0,a0WG000000JfD7bMAF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Low,0,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Closed,Downloading FEC with N2 address 150,0,0,0,0.011173333,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE

After multiple times it failed to go through. I will attach the migration report and maybe you can help me decipher it.Â <br><br>[Issue 2:] ... my computer shut down for an update and changed my host ID for my 14.2 workbench. Here is the kicker, my fx workbench 6.0 runs fine. I uninstalled it and haven&#39;t installed again to see if it works but I would reckon that if we changed the license file on the license server to represent the Host id that the 14.2 workbench gives me it won&#39;t allow me to use 6.0.... I have had windows updates change Host ID&#39;s before but no I can use one workbench and not the other. Very odd. Your help on this issue would be greatly appreciated.&quot;Â <br><br><br>With respect to Issue 1 &quot;Migration failed&quot; .. the migration report you forwarded includes the following line...Â <br>&quot;Exception migratingÂ <a href=""file:///C:/Users/Ryan/Niagara4.2/tridium/migTemp/ST_Joseph/Graphics/CW"" target=""_blank"">C:\Users\Ryan\Niagara4.2\tridium\migTemp\ST_Joseph\Graphics\CW</a>Â Graphics Dash Board.px:javax.baja.xml.XException:Â <br>Cannot decode INumericToSimple.map [line 179]&quot; [see also &#39;Migration report excerpt.PNG&#39;]Â <br>... so it looks like there is some component that is part of &quot;CW Graphics Dash Board.px&quot; that the migrator is having trouble decoding. It is difficult for me to be more specific without actually being able to see this station, but one simple thing to try would be for Mr. Brothers to delete the Px file of that name from the original station and then retry. If the migration is successful after this step, then he can go back to the original station and try to isolated exactly which grahic widget is the problem.Â <br><br><br>With respect to Issue 2 &quot;Host ID changed following Windows update&quot; ... I would encourage Mr. Brothers to follow through on his Wb 6.0 uninstall / reinstall to confirm that the two versions of Wb now all reference the new Host ID. After that, he can request a license transfer.Â <br><br>I will leave this case open for 3 days in the event that you have any followup questions.&quot;<br><br>W Cooper Mar 6/17: Â &quot;Thanks John, this issue has been resolved.&quot;",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,FALSE,005G0000007Zl8GIAS,2017-02-23T16:01:30.000Z,0,01tG000000LNtyxIAD,aDUG0000000PBCQOA4,0,0,0,a0WG000000JgZYBMA3,0,0,William Cooper,0,0,0,0,Close Case in 3 days,Low,0,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Closed,odd issue with Host ID and migration failure,0,72.00493639,0,0.877425278,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE
